# Logistics-Regression

The very aim for this project is to predict whether a person makes over $50K a year or not from the given data set. 

We will be working on the data set using Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas and Seaborn. Later on, we will be using scikit package to call LogisticRegression class

While EDA, we found that Data doesn't contain any Null Values and the Data Types for each feature seems accurate. Hence, we went ahead on checking the duplicated values.

Later the data was divided into Categorical and Numerical in order to apply Label Encoder. 

Next, we applied StandardScaler and trained the data.

While evaluating, we noticed that the data is Imbalance, hence we won't be able to accurate results.
